/**
 * The runner loop (plans/hosted-agents-v2.md step 3).
 *
 * Three behaviors, in order of importance:
 *
 * 1. **Poll is the clock** (§3.3). There is no scheduler anywhere; the runner
 *    long-polls, executes what it is given, and reports back.
 * 2. **Reconcile is the truth** (and the teardown path). What the control
 *    plane says this runner should host is authoritative; anything labeled as
 *    ours and absent from that list is destroyed — container and volume. This
 *    is how deleting an agent reaches the compute plane, and it is crash-safe
 *    by construction: a runner that died mid-delete cleans up on next boot.
 * 3. **Starts are idempotent.** A start for a sandbox whose payload hash is
 *    unchanged just starts the existing container; a changed payload (a
 *    regenerated token) recreates it. Both paths converge on "the container
 *    matches the payload the control plane last handed us".
